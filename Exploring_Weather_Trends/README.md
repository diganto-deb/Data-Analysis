## Exploring Weather Trends
### Summary
In this project, I analyzed local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends
where I live (Bangalore) to overall global temperature trends.
### Project outline
Goal is to create a visualize and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences
between global temperature trends and temperature trends in Bangalore. To do this:
<ul>

<li>Extracted the data from the database using SQL Query.</li>
<li>Created a line chart that compares Bangaloreâ€™s temperatures with the global temperatures.
For this purpose <b> moving average </b> rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the
lines, making trends more observable.</li>
<li>Made observation based on the line chart.</li>
