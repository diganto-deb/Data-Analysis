# Analyze A/B Testing
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. The aim of A/B testing is to enable you to make incremental improvements to your website or app. By pitting your current website or app against one or more variations, you can constantly iterate your design and validate this with real users.
## Overview
In this project we try to analyze whether a company should use its old page or new page to attarct more users on their website.
## Findings
Based on the statistical analysis (Bootstrapping sampling distributions and p-value calculations, Z-core tests, Logistic regression,Multiple linear regression modelling to assess for interactions of independent variables) we did not find any compelling evdidence to recommend that the new page results in more conversions than old page .
